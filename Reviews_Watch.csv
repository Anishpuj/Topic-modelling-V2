B0B3GJYFQX,Seiko Analog Stainless Steel Blue Dial Silver Band Men's Watch-SSK003K1,Good Watch but worst user experience,3,"Watch Quality: Watch is good but no concrete way to confirm authenticity, apart from dual language date. Not suitable for big dial lovers. Although it's 37.3MM, it looks a bit small. Classy and elegant with a retro vibe. Power reserve around 80 hrs. Packaging: Worst packaging, no cushioning. Lucky it wasn’t damaged. Overall: Watch seemed like an old 2022 showpiece, no protective layer, bad unboxing experience. Didn't feel worth 30K."

B0B3GJYFQX,Seiko Analog Stainless Steel Blue Dial Silver Band Men's Watch-SSK003K1,"Watch doesn't work properly, shows 4 hour difference in time",1,"Amazon has become a hub of scam. Rs 35,000 watch doesn't work properly — shows 4 hour difference in time in every 24 hours. Amazon doesn't pick up return or refund if purchase is a high-value product. I will never buy any high-value product again on Amazon. Their customer support is trained to scam customers when they purchase expensive products."

B0B3GJYFQX,Seiko Analog Stainless Steel Blue Dial Silver Band Men's Watch-SSK003K1,Best Value for money GMT on the market,5,"You won't find a better value-for-money watch than this, especially with a GMT feature. One of my friends said it looks like a Rolex GMT Master 2 Batman. You can track 3 different time zones on your wrist. Beats the Apple Watch in that category. The movement is solid and reliable, though not as accurate as some of the more expensive watches. It’s still rock solid. My only issue is Seiko could have used a Sapphire crystal instead of Hardlex, which feels cheap. Also, the bracelet clasp could have been more solid; it's just stamped stainless steel. Still, the bracelet is very comfortable to wear."
