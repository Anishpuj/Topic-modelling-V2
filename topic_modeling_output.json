And there is no way to install third party apps. Worst part is it's store doesn't even have basic android tv apps. Second it's a 5 years old model so interface is a old samsung operating system. Which looks really outdated. It's energy consumption rating is 2star which is again really outdated, means it consumes more electricity. I'm giving it 2 star because seller tried to hide these things by not mentioning it in description. Overall pretty decent picture quality.",
